# tracexec

A small utility for tracing execve{,at} and pre-exec behavior.

tracexec helps you to figure out what and how programs get executed when you execute a command.

It's useful for debugging build systems, understanding what shell scripts actually do, figuring out what programs
does a proprietary software run, etc.

## Showcases

### TUI mode with pseudo terminal

In TUI mode with a pseudo terminal, you can view the details of exec events and interact with the processes
within the pseudo terminal at ease.

![TUI demo](https://github.com/kxxt/tracexec/blob/main/screenshots/tui-demo.gif?raw=true)

### Tracing setuid binaries

With root privileges, you can also trace setuid binaries and see how they work.
But do note that this is not compatible with seccomp-bpf optimization so it is much less performant.

```
sudo tracexec --user $(whoami) tui -t -- sudo ls
```

![Tracing sudo ls](https://github.com/kxxt/tracexec/blob/main/screenshots/tracing-sudo.png?raw=true)

Nested setuid binary tracing is also possible: A real world use case is to trace `extra-x86_64-build`(Arch Linux's build tool that requires sudo):

![Tracing extra-x86_64-build](https://github.com/kxxt/tracexec/blob/main/screenshots/tracing-nested-setuid.gif?raw=true)

In this real world example, we can easily see that `_FORTIFY_SOURCE` is redefined from `2` to `3`, which lead to a compiler error.

### Use tracexec as a debugger launcher

tracexec can also be used as a debugger launcher to make debugging programs easier. For example, it's not trivial or convenient
to debug a program executed by a shell/python script(which can use pipes as stdio for the program). The following video shows how to
use tracexec to launch gdb to detach two simple programs piped together by a shell script.

Please [read the gdb-launcher example](https://github.com/kxxt/tracexec/blob/main/demonstration/gdb-launcher/README.md) for more details.

### Log mode

In log mode, by default, `tracexec` will print filename, argv and the diff of the environment variables and file descriptors.

example: `tracexec log -- bash` (In an interactive bash shell)

### Reconstruct the command line with `--show-cmdline`

```bash
$ tracexec log --show-cmdline -- <command>
# example:
$ tracexec log --show-cmdline -- firefox
```

### Try to reproduce stdio in the reconstructed command line

`--stdio-in-cmdline` and `--fd-in-cmdline` can be used to reproduce(hopefully) the stdio used by a process.

But do note that the result might be inaccurate when pipes, sockets, etc are involved.

```bash
tracexec log --show-cmdline --stdio-in-cmdline -- bash
```

### Show the interpreter indicated by shebang with `--show-interpreter`

And show the cwd with `--show-cwd`.

```bash
$ tracexec log --show-interpreter --show-cwd -- <command>
# example: Running Arch Linux makepkg
$ tracexec log --show-interpreter --show-cwd -- makepkg -f
```

## Installation

### From source

Via cargo:

```bash
cargo install tracexec --bin tracexec
```

Arch Linux users can also install from the official repositories via `pacman -S tracexec`.

### Binary

You can download the binary from the [release page](https://github.com/kxxt/tracexec/releases)

## Profile

`tracexec` can be configured with a profile file. The profile file is a toml file that can be used to set fallback options.

The profile file should be placed at `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/tracexec/` or `$HOME/.config/tracexec/` and named `config.toml`.

A template profile file can be found at https://github.com/kxxt/tracexec/blob/main/config.toml

As a warning, the profile format is not stable yet and may change in the future. You may need to update your profile file when upgrading tracexec.

## Known issues

- Non UTF-8 strings are converted to UTF-8 in a lossy way, which means that the output may be inaccurate.
- The output is not stable yet, which means that the output may change in the future.
- Test coverage is not good enough.
- The pseudo terminal can't pass through certain key combinations and terminal features.

## Origin

This project was born out of the need to trace the execution of programs.

Initially I simply use `strace -Y -f -qqq -s99999 -e trace=execve,execveat <command>`.

But the output is still too verbose so that's why I created this project.

## Credits

This project takes inspiration from [strace](https://strace.io/) and [lurk](https://github.com/JakWai01/lurk).
